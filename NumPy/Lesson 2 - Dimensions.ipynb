But the intensity of each color in computer form represents brightness. This means we have a white, but that is only half as bring as the (255,255,255). What does less bright white make? The answer is grey. We would thereby have a 50% grey shade. (255,255,255) would similarly be 100% grey, but 100% grey is called white. \n",
